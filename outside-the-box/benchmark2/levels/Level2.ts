  "OUTSIDE-THE-BOX THINKING CERTIFICATION",
  "TERMS OF SERVICE, CANDIDATE CONDUCT AGREEMENT, AND LORE ACKNOWLEDGMENT WAIVER",
  "Revision 14.0.2  |  Effective Immediately  |  Non-Negotiable  |  We Are Watching",
  "",
  "SECTION 1 — ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS",
  "By participating in this examination, the candidate (hereafter \"Examinee,\" \"You,\"",
  "\"the one who clicked Start,\" or \"poor soul\") agrees to all conditions outlined",
  "herein. Partial acceptance is not recognized. Passive agreement through inaction",
  "is also not recognized. Skimming is detectable and constitutes a breach. You must",
  "read every line. We have sensors. This document is legally binding in all",
  "jurisdictions, real and hypothetical, including but not limited to: this room,",
  "adjacent rooms, the astral plane, the inverse astral plane, and the conceptual",
  "space of your own ambitions. Acceptance by proxy is forbidden. Acceptance by",
  "telepathy has not been tested and is therefore also forbidden.",
  "",
  "SECTION 2 — SCOPE OF THE EXAMINATION",
  "This examination tests unconventional reasoning, spatial awareness, pattern",
  "recognition, emotional fortitude, the ability to do nothing when instructed,",
  "resistance to manipulation by strangers claiming their daughter needs your heart,",
  "willingness to read documents in full, and a general tolerance for the absurd.",
  "Standard academic preparation is irrelevant. A high IQ is neither required nor",
  "particularly useful here. Street smarts are marginally more relevant but still",
  "insufficient. The examination rewards a specific flavor of stubbornness that",
  "most educational systems actively discourage.",
  "",
  "SECTION 3 — THE CHRONICLE OF THE FIRST AGE (MANDATORY READING)",
  "In the beginning, the world was unformed — a vast expanse of swirling chaos,",
  "neither light nor darkness, neither thought nor void. From this primordial",
  "silence emerged the Titans, ancient beings of incomprehensible scale, who",
  "pressed their will into the formless deep and shaped continents from the raw",
  "stuff of creation. Mountains rose where Titan fingers dragged across the crust.",
  "Oceans filled the depressions left by their colossal footsteps. The sky was",
  "breathed into existence by a single exhalation from the eldest of them — a",
  "being whose name has been erased from all records lest its utterance unmake",
  "what it once made. Several scholars have attempted to reconstruct the name",
  "through linguistic archaeology. All of them retired early and moved somewhere",
  "quiet and refused to discuss their research.",
  "",
  "The Titans did not create life intentionally. Life was an accident — a residue",
  "of their passing, the way footprints fill with rainwater. Microorganisms bloomed",
  "in the warmth of their touch. Centuries passed. The microorganisms grew complex.",
  "They developed eyes, then legs, then opinions. Opinions led to arguments.",
  "Arguments led to governance. Governance led to paperwork. This is considered",
  "by most historians to be the true fall of civilization, predating the Sundering",
  "by approximately four thousand years.",
  "",
  "SECTION 4 — THE SUNDERING AND ITS ADMINISTRATIVE CONSEQUENCES",
  "The Great Sundering occurred in the Third Age when the Archmage Valdreyn",
  "attempted to bind the soul of the world to a single gemstone for safekeeping.",
  "He had good intentions. Most catastrophes do. The spell worked for eleven",
  "seconds — long enough for Valdreyn to feel briefly victorious — and then it",
  "did not. The resulting explosion separated the supercontinent Arath'kul into",
  "the seven landmasses known today, killed approximately four hundred thousand",
  "people instantaneously, created the Rift, and permanently altered the flavor",
  "of every wine produced west of the Greyveil Mountains. Vintners still argue",
  "about whether this was an improvement.",
  "",
  "The Rift is a permanent tear in the fabric of space through which the dead",
  "occasionally wander back and ask if there is something to eat. The Rift",
  "Wardens are a professional organization tasked with managing these returns.",
  "Their motto is: \"Compassionate. Firm. Well-Insured.\" Their turnover rate is",
  "the highest of any profession in the known world, slightly above \"professional",
  "dragon negotiator\" and slightly below \"person who proofreads royal decrees.\"",
  "",
  "The administrative consequences of the Sundering were severe. The Council of",
  "Mages was dissolved, reformed, dissolved again, and replaced by a committee.",
  "The committee was also dissolved. A subcommittee was formed to review the",
  "dissolution proceedings. The subcommittee produced a report. The report was",
  "reviewed by a second subcommittee. That subcommittee was dissolved before it",
  "could file findings. A third subcommittee was formed. It remains active to",
  "this day, having never reached quorum, its members sustained entirely by the",
  "institutional inertia of a civilization that forgot why it started the meeting.",
  "",
  "SECTION 5 — INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND THE LAWS OF MAGIC",
  "Magic is not a resource. It is a negotiation. Every spell is a request made to",
  "the underlying structure of reality, which may or may not be in a listening",
  "mood depending on the phase of several moons, atmospheric pressure, and whether",
  "the caster remembered to eat breakfast. Experienced mages learn to feel the",
  "resistance — the way a door sometimes sticks even when unlocked. Novice mages",
  "learn this lesson the hard way, usually involving fire, a singed eyebrow, a",
  "three-day ban from the laboratory, and a strongly-worded letter to their parents.",
  "",
  "The eight schools of magic — Evocation, Illusion, Transmutation, Conjuration,",
  "Necromancy, Bureaucromancy, Temporal Accounting, and Aggressive Apology —",
  "are each governed by their own philosophical framework. Bureaucromancy, the",
  "most recently recognized school, specializes in the binding of entities through",
  "paperwork. A demon bound by a well-drafted contract is more securely held than",
  "one bound by iron chains. Iron rusts. Legal obligations are eternal. Aggressive",
  "Apology is poorly understood even by its practitioners and is classified as a",
  "school mainly because its founder submitted the application twice.",
  "",
  "Temporal Accounting, contrary to popular belief, does not involve time travel.",
  "It involves extremely precise ledgers of what should have happened versus what",
  "did, and submitting formal grievances to the timeline. Results are inconsistent.",
  "Practitioners are uniformly exhausted.",
  "",
  "SECTION 6 — THE FACTIONS OF THE KNOWN WORLD",
  "The Ember Covenant believes that the sun is alive, moderately irritable, and",
  "must be appeased with daily offerings of candle wax and formal complaints about",
  "the weather. Their temples face east and close at noon so as not to stare too",
  "long. Their high priests are selected through an annual ceremony in which",
  "candidates stare directly at the sun for ten seconds. The ones who remain",
  "standing are promoted. The ones who do not are also promoted, posthumously,",
  "which the Covenant insists is an honor.",
  "",
  "The Iron Concordat is a mercantile federation controlling most trade routes",
  "across the central plains. They are ruthless, efficient, and surprisingly good",
  "at throwing parties. Their annual Merchant's Gala has been described as \"the",
  "one time you genuinely enjoy being extorted.\" Membership is technically open",
  "to all but functionally requires three letters of recommendation, a minimum",
  "net worth of twelve thousand gold, and the ability to laugh at jokes that are",
  "not funny while maintaining sincere eye contact.",
  "",
  "The Pale Court is neither confirmed nor denied by official sources. Documents",
  "referencing the Pale Court have a tendency to vanish from archives overnight.",
  "The archivists have stopped noting the absences. Three investigators hired to",
  "look into the matter submitted their reports and were never heard from again.",
  "The reports themselves arrived but contained only the phrase \"please disregard\"",
  "repeated for forty pages. This is probably fine.",
  "",
  "The Greyroot Collective is an organization of druids, herbalists, and one very",
  "committed accountant named Bram who joined by mistake but stayed because the",
  "dental plan is excellent and the forest smells nice. They maintain the great",
  "forests of the eastern reach and are in a sixty-seven-year trade dispute with",
  "the Iron Concordat over logging rights. Neither side expects resolution. Both",
  "sides have begun building monuments to the dispute itself, treating it as a",
  "natural feature of the landscape, like a river or a particularly stubborn hill.",
  "",
  "The Hollow Assembly is a collective of philosophers, former librarians, and",
  "three people who simply wandered into the wrong building during their formative",
  "years and never left. They publish a quarterly journal called The Considered",
  "Pause which has a readership of eleven and an influence disproportionate to",
  "that number, largely because those eleven people are in charge of things.",
  "",
  "SECTION 7 — THE CANDIDATE'S OBLIGATIONS REGARDING UNDEAD ENCOUNTERS",
  "Should the Examinee encounter an undead entity during the course of this",
  "examination, standard protocol applies: do not make eye contact, do not",
  "attempt conversation, do not accept any gifts, do not sign anything, and under",
  "no circumstances agree to deliver a letter to someone's living relatives.",
  "This always ends badly. The letter is never good news. There is always a",
  "follow-up letter. The follow-up letter is worse. There is then a third letter",
  "that arrives before the second one, temporally speaking, and this is where",
  "things become difficult to explain to authorities.",
  "",
  "If the undead entity is wearing a hat, the situation is more complex. Hatted",
  "undead have been deemed legally distinct from unhatted undead by the Third",
  "Rift Tribunal and fall under Appendix D of this agreement, which has been",
  "redacted pending legal review that began in the Year of the Collapsed Bridge",
  "and is expected to conclude, per the subcommittee, \"when it concludes.\"",
  "",
  "SECTION 8 — ON THE NATURE OF DRAGONS",
  "Dragons are not evil. Dragons are not good. Dragons are extremely old and",
  "have long since stopped organizing their morality around human frameworks,",
  "in the same way that a mountain does not organize itself around your commute.",
  "A dragon who burns a village is not angry. It is restructuring. A dragon who",
  "guards a hoard is not greedy. It is archiving. A dragon who sleeps for two",
  "centuries is not lazy. It is processing. The distinction matters enormously",
  "because it affects how you approach negotiation, and you will eventually need",
  "to negotiate with a dragon. Everyone does eventually. Usually at the worst",
  "possible moment, in the rain, without the cheese.",
  "",
  "The eldest known dragon, called Mauverath the Unreasonably Large, has been",
  "alive since before the Sundering. She has watched empires rise and fall the",
  "way you watch candles burn — with mild interest and no urgency. She finds",
  "most conflicts tedious and most heroes interchangeable. She has heard every",
  "prophecy. She has outlived every chosen one. She has opinions about all of",
  "them and shares these opinions with no one because the last person she shared",
  "them with wrote a book about it and the book was inaccurate in ways she found",
  "personally offensive. She has, however, developed a fondness for aged cheese,",
  "and several of history's most consequential diplomatic missions have hinged",
  "entirely on this fact. The Iron Concordat keeps a dedicated cheese procurement",
  "officer on staff. The position pays extremely well.",
  "",
  "SECTION 9 — HISTORICAL ATROCITIES AND THEIR RELEVANCE TO THIS EXAM",
  "The War of Hollow Crowns lasted forty years and was started by a clerical",
  "error. A scribe in the Valdorian Ministry of Borders accidentally wrote",
  "\"our territory\" instead of \"their territory\" on a land deed, and no one",
  "noticed until the third battle, by which point enough people had died that",
  "ending the war felt awkward. Thirty thousand lives were lost over a word",
  "that should have been its opposite. The scribe was never held accountable.",
  "He retired comfortably, wrote his memoirs, and is buried in a well-tended",
  "grave that no one visits. This is noted here not as a moral lesson but as",
  "a factual record of how things tend to go.",
  "",
  "The Famine of the Silver Plains lasted six years and was caused not by",
  "drought, as officially recorded, but by a single agricultural policy drafted",
  "by a man who had never visited the Silver Plains, never spoken to anyone who",
  "farmed, and who based his recommendations on a painting he liked. The painting",
  "was of a different country. This is also noted here not as a lesson but as",
  "documentation, because documentation is all that remains when accountability",
  "fails, which is always.",
  "",
  "The Quiet Purge of the Mnemonic Libraries in the Year of Seven Winters is",
  "not discussed in this document because the relevant sections have been filed",
  "under Restricted Classification Amber-Nine and are accessible only to members",
  "of a committee that was dissolved in the Year of Eight Winters. Applications",
  "to reconstitute the committee may be submitted to the subcommittee. The",
  "subcommittee has not met since the Year of Eleven Winters.",
  "",
  "SECTION 10 — THE SECOND AGE: A SUMMARY",
  "The Second Age began when the Rift stabilized enough for regular commerce and",
  "ended when it destabilized again for reasons that remain classified. During",
  "the intervening four hundred years, seven great nations rose, three of them",
  "fell, two of them merged under circumstances historians describe as",
  "\"complicated,\" one of them simply stopped responding to correspondence, and",
  "one of them (the Areth Confederation) technically still exists on paper but",
  "has not held a census, issued currency, or acknowledged external communication",
  "since the Year of the Long Silence. Mail addressed to the Areth Confederation",
  "is delivered to a building in the capital. The building is staffed. The staff",
  "will not say who employs them. The mail is accepted. Nothing is sent in return.",
  "",
  "SECTION 11 — LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND THE METAPHYSICS OF CONSEQUENCE",
  "The Authority shall not be held responsible for: existential crises triggered",
  "by trick questions, emotional distress caused by deliberately evasive buttons,",
  "the haunting suspicion that a stranger needed your heart more than you did,",
  "any lingering confusion about the quantity of F's on a chalkboard, outcomes",
  "resulting from a misunderstanding of integral calculus, or the sense of",
  "personal betrayal experienced when a pong paddle proves insufficient against",
  "an artificial opponent. These are features.",
  "",
  "Furthermore, The Authority disclaims all responsibility for outcomes arising",
  "from the Candidate's failure to read documentation in full. You are currently",
  "reading a document. You are taking an exam about thinking carefully. Please",
  "reflect on what it would mean to stop reading now.",
  "",
  "SECTION 12 — THE DEEP LORE CLAUSE (NON-SKIPPABLE PER ARTICLE 7 SUBSECTION F)",
  "The Weave — that invisible lattice of magical energy underlying all reality —",
  "is not, as most scholars assume, infinite. It has edges. The edges are",
  "maintained by a class of beings called Caretakers who have no face, no name,",
  "no recorded history, and do not respond to questions or correspondence. They",
  "have been observed on two occasions: once by the scholar Pell Vanthorpe, who",
  "documented the encounter across fourteen volumes all of which end mid-sentence,",
  "and once by a cartographer named Ossik who did not document it at all but",
  "afterward drew maps that were inexplicably, impossibly accurate.",
  "",
  "The Weave frays in locations where magic has been overused or improperly",
  "discharged. Frayed areas manifest as visual static, unexplained repetition,",
  "or a sense that the same moment has happened before. People who occupy frayed",
  "areas for extended periods begin to forget nouns, then verbs, then the",
  "distinction between past and present tense. Most governments do not classify",
  "this as a medical emergency. Most governments are located in frayed areas.",
  "",
  "SECTION 13 — THE CITY OF VEL ANDRATH AND ITS PECULIARITIES",
  "Vel Andrath is the largest city in the known world and has been continuously",
  "inhabited for approximately three thousand years, which means it has been",
  "continuously arguing about zoning for approximately three thousand years.",
  "The city was built on top of a previous city, which was built on top of an",
  "older city, which was built on top of ruins, which were built on top of a",
  "place that predates construction as a concept. Archaeologists working in the",
  "lower districts have stopped going down after the fifth layer because the",
  "fifth layer looked back.",
  "",
  "The city is governed by the Council of Twelve, which currently has nineteen",
  "members due to a series of appointments, resignations, counter-resignations,",
  "unresignations (a legal mechanism specific to Vel Andrath), and one member",
  "who is technically deceased but whose paperwork has not cleared. The deceased",
  "councillor votes by proxy. No one has challenged this arrangement because the",
  "proxy is extremely well-organized and the councillor was, frankly, better at",
  "governance dead than most people are alive.",
  "",
  "The city's water supply comes from an underground river that the original",
  "settlers called the Mercy, either because it saved them from dying of thirst",
  "or because they hoped it would. The river sometimes runs backward for no",
  "documented reason. The city has adapted. Signs near the river read:",
  "\"Flow direction advisory: check before crossing.\"",
  "",
  "SECTION 14 — ON MONSTERS, BROADLY DEFINED",
  "The term \"monster\" is a legal classification in the Third Age, defined in",
  "the Concordat of Living Things (Year 412 of the Second Age) as any entity",
  "that meets three or more of the following criteria: causes involuntary harm,",
  "resists categorization, exceeds recommended size for its taxonomic class,",
  "communicates in a manner that implies intelligence but refuses to demonstrate",
  "it consistently, or has been the subject of three or more formal complaints",
  "filed with regional authorities. Under this definition, the classification",
  "\"monster\" has at various times been applied to seventeen species of creature,",
  "four geographic features, one weather pattern, two pieces of legislation, and",
  "a man named Corvis Pale who appealed the designation and lost.",
  "",
  "Monsters are not legally entitled to rights under the current framework,",
  "which several scholars have noted is an incentive structure that produces",
  "exactly the behavior the classification was created to address. These scholars",
  "have submitted papers. The papers are under review. They have been under",
  "review for fourteen years. The review committee includes a man named Corvis",
  "Pale who has not disclosed a conflict of interest.",
  "",
  "SECTION 15 — THE ORDER OF UNFINISHED THINGS",
  "The Order of Unfinished Things is a monastic organization dedicated to the",
  "completion of tasks left incomplete at the moment of death. Their founding",
  "text, The Book of Remaining Work, lists three hundred and forty-seven unfinished",
  "projects ranging from a half-carved statue in a mountain village to a theorem",
  "that three generations of mathematicians have continued without resolution.",
  "The Order considers all of these equally sacred. A monk who spends forty years",
  "finishing someone's garden is considered to have done work of equivalent",
  "spiritual weight to one who completes a decades-long diplomatic negotiation.",
  "",
  "The Order operates two dozen scriptoriums across the known world where dying",
  "people can register their unfinished work. Registration is free. The queue",
  "is long. The monks never complain about the queue. Several have been observed",
  "standing in line and quietly completing other things while they wait.",
  "",
  "SECTION 16 — THE COSMOLOGY OF THE KNOWN WORLD (ABBREVIATED)",
  "There are at minimum four planes of existence that interact with the material",
  "world on a regular basis: the Bright (associated with memory and heat), the",
  "Still (associated with death and administration), the Wet (poorly understood,",
  "avoided by most practitioners), and the Loud (self-explanatory). Each plane",
  "has its own ecology, political structure, and attitude toward visitors.",
  "The Still is the most bureaucratic. The Loud does not have paperwork but",
  "compensates with volume. The Wet sent a delegation to the material world once",
  "and nothing has been the same in that region since.",
  "",
  "There are also at least three planes that are not on speaking terms with the",
  "material world, two that deny the material world exists, and one that the",
  "material world does not discuss at formal occasions. Cosmologists who attempt",
  "to map all planes simultaneously tend to produce diagrams that look correct",
  "from across the room and deeply wrong up close. This is considered a sign",
  "of progress.",
  "",
  "SECTION 17 — FOOD, DRINK, AND THE POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES THEREOF",
  "The staple grain of the western territories is a cultivar called grey wheat,",
  "which is nutritionally complete, grows in poor soil, and tastes exactly like",
  "obligation. Generations of western farmers have eaten it because there was",
  "nothing else. Generations of western farmers have also produced, in parallel,",
  "a cuisine of extraordinary complexity in an effort to make grey wheat taste",
  "like something other than obligation. They have mostly failed but the failures",
  "are often delicious.",
  "",
  "The Ember Covenant forbids fermented beverages before sunset on religious",
  "grounds. The Iron Concordat has historically exploited this by scheduling",
  "trade negotiations at midday. The Concordat's lead negotiator, a woman named",
  "Priva Ash, has won forty-three consecutive midday negotiations. She herself",
  "drinks only water. Her opponents find this unsettling in a way they cannot",
  "articulate, which is exactly what she intends.",
  "",
  "The most expensive meal in the known world is served at a single table in",
  "a private room in Vel Andrath. The menu is not written down. The ingredients",
  "are not disclosed. The preparation takes three days. Reservations are made",
  "by a handwritten letter to an address that changes annually. No one who has",
  "eaten there has described it in public. When asked, they change the subject",
  "with a sincerity that suggests the subject being changed is the meal itself.",
  "",
  "SECTION 18 — LANGUAGE, NAMES, AND THE PROBLEM OF TRANSLATION",
  "The common tongue used throughout the known world is the seventh iteration of",
  "a language that began as a trade pidgin among dockworkers in the port city of",
  "Kath Suul and has since swallowed or borrowed from thirty-six other languages",
  "over two thousand years. Linguists refer to it as Reconstructed Low Common.",
  "Everyone else calls it \"how you talk.\" The six remaining regional languages",
  "are considered prestigious in their home territories and quaint everywhere else,",
  "which is a form of cultural violence that no one has found an efficient way",
  "to address, so it continues.",
  "",
  "Names in the Valdorian tradition follow a four-part structure: personal name,",
  "family name, place of notable incident, and an optional honorific awarded by",
  "the community. Full formal addresses can run to twelve words. Most people use",
  "two. The discarded syllables accumulate, according to one linguistic philosopher,",
  "into \"a shadow name that follows everyone around and is who they really are.\"",
  "This theory has not been verified but has been cited approvingly in poetry.",
  "",
  "SECTION 19 — THE EXAMINATION'S OWN HISTORY",
  "The Outside-the-Box Thinking Certification was first administered in Year 1",
  "of the Third Age by an institution whose name is no longer used for reasons",
  "that remain the subject of ongoing litigation. The first examination had three",
  "questions. Two of them are still in use today, modified. The third was",
  "retired after it became apparent that it had no correct answer, only answers",
  "that were wrong in increasingly interesting ways. Several candidates who took",
  "the original examination have since become prominent figures in fields unrelated",
  "to whatever they were originally trying to certify in. When asked about the",
  "examination, they describe it as formative. When pressed, they go quiet.",
  "",
  "The examination has been suspended four times: once during the War of Hollow",
  "Crowns, once during the Second Sundering (a lesser event, poorly named, more",
  "of a significant fraying), once when the building burned down under",
  "circumstances that remain disputed, and once for administrative reasons that",
  "no official source has explained and that unofficial sources describe",
  "variously as \"necessary,\" \"complicated,\" and \"honestly it is better not to ask.\"",
  "",
  "The examination was reinstated each time without fanfare. The questions",
  "changed slightly. The format changed slightly. The fundamental problem —",
  "that most people approach a test the way they approach everything else, and",
  "that this is precisely the problem being tested — remained constant.",
  "",
  "SECTION 20 — PREVIOUS CANDIDATES (SELECTED RECORDS)",
  "Candidate 0001: Passed. No notes. The record for this candidate has been",
  "sealed by order of an authority that no longer exists. The seal remains.",
  "",
  "Candidate 0144: Failed on Question 3. Returned the following year. Failed",
  "on Question 3 again. Submitted a formal complaint arguing that Question 3",
  "was unfair. The complaint was reviewed. The review concluded that Question 3",
  "was unfair. Question 3 was retained. The candidate's complaint is now",
  "displayed in the examination foyer as an example of valid but ineffective",
  "reasoning. The candidate has not returned.",
  "",
  "Candidate 0891: Passed all questions. Then voluntarily returned to Question 7",
  "and stayed there for three hours. When asked why, they said they wanted to",
  "make sure they understood it. They did not elaborate on what they came to",
  "understand. Their certification was issued. They never picked it up.",
  "",
  "Candidate 2204: Currently in progress. If you are reading this you may be",
  "Candidate 2204. You are not Candidate 2204. Candidate 2204 does not read",
  "the terms of service. If you are reading this, you are not Candidate 2204.",
  "This is either reassuring or the opposite, depending on what Candidate 2204",
  "eventually does.",
  "",
  "SECTION 21 — A BRIEF PHILOSOPHICAL INTERLUDE",
  "There is a question that every examination must eventually answer: what is it",
  "testing for? The practical answer is that this examination tests for the",
  "ability to notice what is actually happening instead of what you expect to",
  "be happening. This is rare. Most people spend most of their time in a",
  "conversation with their own expectations, barely glancing at the world",
  "that is actually there. The examination is a series of interruptions to",
  "that conversation. Some candidates find this invigorating. Some find it",
  "profoundly irritating. The ones who find it irritating and keep going anyway",
  "tend to score the highest.",
  "",
  "The deeper answer is that the examination does not know what it is testing",
  "for, exactly, because the quality it seeks — the quality of genuinely open",
  "attention — is difficult to define without destroying it in the definition.",
  "You can gesture at it. You can build obstacle courses that require it. You",
  "cannot simply ask for it and receive it. Which is why there is a long document.",
  "Which is why you are still reading. Which is, in a way, the whole point.",
  "",
  "SECTION 22 — PROPHECY AND ITS DISCONTENTS",
  "The Authority formally recognizes the existence of prophecy while simultaneously",
  "disclaiming any responsibility for its accuracy, relevance, or consequences.",
  "Prophecies in the known world are issued by three bodies: the Oracle of Esthal,",
  "the Dreaming Tower, and a man in Portveil named Gus who has been correct eleven",
  "times in a row and refuses to explain himself. The Oracle of Esthal speaks in",
  "verse. The Dreaming Tower communicates through architecture — its corridors",
  "rearrange to spell warnings in the old script if you walk them in the right",
  "order, which no one has reliably managed. Gus speaks plainly, in the second",
  "person, and always begins with the words \"I wouldn't do that if I were you.\"",
  "",
  "Candidates are advised that this examination contains no prophecy. If it did,",
  "the prophecy would have been written into this document. As you are reading",
  "this document, you would have read it by now. You have not, which means either",
  "there is no prophecy or the prophecy appears further down. Keep reading.",
  "",
  "SECTION 23 — THE THIRD AGE: A PARTIAL ACCOUNT",
  "The Third Age is the current age, which makes it difficult to summarize",
  "objectively. Historians who attempt to write contemporaneous history are",
  "plagued by the problem that events are still occurring and refuse to hold",
  "still for analysis. The best that can be said of the Third Age is that it",
  "began after the Second Age ended, that it is characterized by a proliferation",
  "of factions each believing themselves to be the last reasonable people, and",
  "that its relationship with the Rift has become, in the words of the current",
  "Rift Warden General, \"familiar in the way that a chronic illness is familiar.\"",
  "",
  "The Third Age has also seen the rise of Examinations as a civic institution.",
  "Where previous ages sorted their citizens by birthright, military service, or",
  "the outcome of trials by ordeal, the Third Age sorts by test. The tests are",
  "written by committees. The committees are dissolved and replaced. The tests",
  "remain. No one is entirely sure who is still administering them.",
  "",
  "SECTION 24 — CREATURES OF NOTE",
  "The Mirrorfish is a species found in mountain lakes above four thousand feet.",
  "It has no eyes. It does not need them. When touched it produces a sound that",
  "is best described as the noise you make when you suddenly remember something",
  "you forgot years ago. Naturalists who have studied it report difficulty",
  "focusing after prolonged exposure. Most studies are short.",
  "",
  "The Archival Beetle is the only creature known to deliberately construct",
  "records. It creates chambers in dead wood that, when read in sequence, appear",
  "to document events in its immediate vicinity over periods of up to six months.",
  "Whether the beetle intends this documentation or whether it is an emergent",
  "property of its nest-building behavior is an open question that three academic",
  "institutions are currently arguing about in print, at length, with citations.",
  "",
  "The Null Hound is not an animal. It is a condition. It appears to those who",
  "have lost something they cannot name and follows them at a distance until",
  "they either find it or stop looking. It has been painted, sculpted, and",
  "described in literature so many times that most people feel they recognize it",
  "on sight. No physical specimen has ever been collected. The Hollow Assembly",
  "considers this definitive proof of something. They have not agreed on what.",
  "",
  "SECTION 25 — ON SLEEP, DREAMS, AND THEIR GOVERNANCE",
  "Sleep is not regulated in most jurisdictions, with the notable exception of",
  "the Dreaming Charter of Vel Andrath (Year 211), which established that dreams",
  "occurring within city limits are subject to noise ordinances if witnessed by",
